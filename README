instructions for working with mtouch.c
1. Change code
2. $ make
   This requires you have everything in place for building linux kernel
   modules out of tree... the Makefile does all the magic related to this
   ... what to do for that and how it all works is documented elsewhere
3. # rmmod mtouch # (if already inserted)
4. # insmod mtouch.ko
5. inputattach -mtouch /dev/ttyS?
   inputattach will block, run with --daemon if need be
6. A /dev/input/event? device node is created, X.org picks up automatically
   no X configuration required
7. terminate inputattach to start again

instructions for mtouchme.py
1. Change code
2. ./mtouchme.py /dev/ttyS?
Doesn't seem to work unless serial initialization magic has
been done with a load of mtouch + inputattach above first
Can't seem to replicate magic with setserial
You can't run inputattach for the kernel module and mtouchme.py at the
same time
